# Demo: Pyspark-Teradata-CSV-Loader

This application was developed for a demo to walkthrough a sample use case for pyspark. In this particular example, we are moving large amounts of data from Teradata to a CSV. 

**Be sure to update the config to reference secrets to be used for your Teradata connection (or any database that you are using)
